How data should be formatted

Classification problems:
    - First column should be the label, or the class the data belongs to
    - All columns should hold integer or floating point values, no alphabet
    - All other columns should hold training data
    - Each value should be seperated by a comma

Regression problems:
    - First column should hold the value to be regressed too
    - All other rules of classification instructions apply

Header should be the first line only
